# EssayHunt Game
This was a group project between myself and 8 other people, to design and code a 2D dungeon-themed rogue-like game.

The game features a student who is trapped in the library and needs to escape! They must collect all of their lost essay pages and battle monsters along the way. As the game progresses, the student travels through history, art, science and music levels in the library, before a final boss battle with the evil librarian. There are four characters to choose from, at the beginning of the game, corresponding to the four subjects.

## To Play
In the `EssayHunt_Game` folder are two zip files, for Windows and Mac. Download the corresponding zip file and double click the EssayHunt .exe or .app file to play the game. All code and associated Unity files are in the `Unity_2D_roguelike` folder.
